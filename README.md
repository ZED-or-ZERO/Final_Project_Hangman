### Final_Project_Hangman
This is the game for the final project in the class on programming in Python. 

## Hangman Game - Python OOP Project

This project implements the classic Hangman word guessing game using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in Python. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Pygame, allowing players to interact with buttons to guess letters and see the hangman image update as they make incorrect guesses.

## Features

- "OOP Design:" The code is organized into classes, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
- "Pygame GUI:" The game utilizes Pygame for creating a visually appealing and interactive interface.
- "Word List:" The game randomly selects words from a text file, offering variety and challenge.
- "Hangman Graphics:" Visual representation of the hangman adds to the game's atmosphere.
- "Win/Loss Conditions:" The game detects and displays appropriate messages for winning or losing scenarios.
- "Main Menu:" The game starts with a main menu where users can initiate the gameplay.
- "Sound Effects and Music:" (Optional) You can enhance the game by adding sound effects for correct/incorrect guesses and background music.

## How to Play

"Run the main.py file:" This will launch the game and display the main menu.
"Click to Start:" Clicking anywhere on the main menu screen will initiate the game.
"Guess Letters:" Click on the letter buttons to guess letters that might be present in the hidden word.
"Track Progress:" Correctly guessed letters will be revealed in the word, while incorrect guesses will add body parts to the hangman image.
"Win or Lose:" The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or the hangman figure is completed.

## Running the Project

- Requirements: Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed (pip install pygame).
- Download/Clone: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
- Run: Execute the main.py file using the command python main.py in your terminal.

## Customization

- Word List: Modify the Words.txt file to add or change the words used in the game.
- Hangman Images: Replace the hangman images in the image_text folder with your own if desired.
- Sound and Music: Add sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.

## Future Improvements

- Difficulty Levels: Implement varying difficulty levels by adjusting the number of allowed guesses or the complexity of the word list.
- Hints System: Provide a hint system to help players when stuck.
- Scorekeeping: Track player performance and display scores.
- Multiplayer Mode: Enable two players to compete against each other.
